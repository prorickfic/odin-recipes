    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        The nectar of Gods!!
        All homemade mead is made from a similar honey mead recipe because it is simply a fermented beverage (like beer) made from honey, water, and yeast. It is one of the oldest fermented beverages known to man.

    <h3>
        Ingredients:
    </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>filtered water (or distilled)</li>
            <li>2-3 pounds honey (local raw honey is best)</li>
            <li>2 g champagne yeast (⅕ – ½ of a 5g package</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>
        Steps:
    </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Simmer ½ gallon of water until warm.</li>
            <li>Add honey: 2 pounds for a dry mead or 3 pounds for a sweet mead. Stir until dissolved.</li>
            <li>Simmer (don't boil) for about 30 minutes, skimming off any scum that forms. Remove from heat and let cool to about 100°F and pour into 1 gallon carboy.</li>
            <li>Add any extra ingredients you may want. See below for ideas.</li>
            <li>When the temperature is below 90°F, add the yeast. One package will make 5 gallons of mead, so use between ⅕ of a package and ½ a package.</li>
            <li>Cap the bottle and shake well. Add more water to fill the bottle, making sure to leave 3-4 inches of headroom at the top. Take the top off and add an airlock. These are available at your local homebrew store or online.</li>
            <li>Once the airlock is in place, set the bottle in a cool spot for about 6 weeks.</li>
        </ol>
